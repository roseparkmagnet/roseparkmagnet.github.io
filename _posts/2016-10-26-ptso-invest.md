Dear Rose Park Families,

Thank you for choosing to send your child to Rose Park Magnet. As parents, we are all committed to providing our children the best education possible, and the Rose Park PTSO is here to support our teachers and our children every step of the way. Together, we form a strong community that will help our children thrive.

**We’re writing today to ask for your support in helping make our Rose Park community even stronger.**

The Invest Campaign is the main source of funding for the PTSO, and **we’re asking every family to give what you can within your budget**. Whether it’s $5 or $500, all donations are welcome. Our goal is to raise $8,000 by November 18. If all 400 families donate to the PTSO’s Invest Campaign, we’ll easily reach that goal.

Each of us is already investing a lot in our child, but your donation to the Rose Park PTSO will open up even more opportunities. With your investment, we’ll be able to:

* Offer grants to teachers to fund fieldtrips
* Support the operation of after-school clubs
* Purchase essential classroom supplies
* Sponsor teacher appreciation celebrations
* Plan family social events

Enhancing our children’s academic, enrichment, and social experience at Rose Park requires resources, and **you** can make a difference.

Please make a gift today and help us **meet our goal by the November 18 deadline!** All Invest Campaign donations are tax deductible. To make your gift, print and complete the [campaign gift form](/media/2016.10.26.rose-park-ptso-invest.pdf) and return it to the PTSO LOCK BOX in the main office.

Sincerely,<br/>
Jen Cole (mom of Owen, 7th grade), PTSO President<br/>
Lauren Clay (mom of Nathaniel, 5th grade), PTSO Co-Treasurer<br/>
Camilla Matthews (mom of Ashley, 5th grade), PTSO Co-Treasurer<br/>
